## SOLID Principles
### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change.

- one responsibility
- orthogonality: independent, isolated
  if you change one component, you don't have to worry about the others.
- decrease coupling: break modules apart until further deviding them
  increases coupling.
- change things in isolation

### Open Closed Principle
Open for extension but closed for modification.
